# MS-Assignment
This is a repository containing the forecasting approach for the Microsoft home assignment.

The folder structure is the following:
* data - folder with the csv dataset
* env - requirments.txt file for my environment
* src - all code used for this assignment is here

I created two separate notebooks for this assignment, the "MS_EDA" which contains the explanatory data analysis did for this assignment and the "MS-Fcast" which contains a methodological approach for my forecasting approach. I tried to documents my though process in a step by step manner as thoroughly as possible. More details regarding the approach can be found in the "MS-Fcast" notebook.
